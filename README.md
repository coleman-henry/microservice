# microservice

## How to use the Microservice:
  1. The Microservice watches a directory for new .json files.
  
  2. When a new .json file appears in the directory, the Microservice checks that it consists of correctly formatted JSON.
  
    * If the JSON is correctly formatted:
      1. Microservice waits for "ready" message on tcp://localhost:5001
      2. After receiving "ready" message, Microservice triggers db.py
      3. After triggering db.py, Microservice deletes .json

    * If the JSON is incorrectly formatted, the microservice sends an error to the console with the name of the .json file.
    
  3. Throughout its lifecycle, the Microservice routes all log and error data to http://localhost:3000/
  4. Upon receiving valid .json, the Microservice routes names and contents of each .json file to http://localhost:3000/json
  

## Request Data: 
  To initiate your database querying program (db.py), send "ready" to tcp://localhost:5001 through your ZeroMQ pipe while the Microservice is running.
  To see all data generated by the Microservice during its lifecycle, open http://localhost:3000/ and http://localhost:3000/json on your browser.
